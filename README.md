# Conjoint-Analysis
The aim of the project was to produce a set of scripts that would perform conjoint analysis on data about a product. The scripts use the data given by consumers about their preferences for a product. The result of a conjoint analysis is a model of the response consumers have towards a certain product in its different attribute settings (price, size, etc).

The initial inspiration for the project came from the client. He wanted to have scripts written in python that depended on nothing but the native language. This was to allow the client to translate the code into other languages at a later date without having to figure out what the dependencies do. Producing these scripts depended upon knowledge of linear algebra and linear regression in multiple dimensions.


The code is documented throught and has a file that explains what the scripts need and what they produce.
